# Project Scope - April 6, 2025
- **Concept**: Financial signals as "wildlife behaviors" (roaring = 1%-3% spikes, purring = stability, hissing = volatility).
- **Data**: Tesla prices, X sentiment, news (NewsAPI) for April 2024 - March 2025 (test dataset; model generalizable to any stock).
- **Split**: Technical (prices), Qualitative (news: Insider vs. Outsider factors), Behavioral (X sentiment).
- **Images**: Stacked layers (candlestick + sentiment + news heatmap, non-overlapping 5-day windows).
- **Target**: Price direction (Up/Down â†’ Buy/Sell) + Spike type (Temporary/Permanent).
- **Goals**: Practical tool for stock prediction (tested on Tesla, generalizable); academic paper on multi-modal image fusion.
