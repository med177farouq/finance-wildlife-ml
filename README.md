# Project Scope - April 6, 2025
- **Concept**: Financial signals as "wildlife behaviors" (roaring = 1%-3% spikes, purring = stability, hissing = volatility).
- **Data**: Tesla prices, X sentiment, news (NewsAPI) for April 2024 - March 2025 (test dataset; model generalizable to any stock).
- **Split**: Technical (prices), Qualitative (news: Insider vs. Outsider factors), Behavioral (X sentiment).
- **Images**: Stacked layers (candlestick + sentiment + news heatmap, non-overlapping 5-day windows).
- **Target**: Price direction (Up/Down → Buy/Sell) + Spike type (Temporary/Permanent).
- **Goals**: Practical tool for stock prediction (tested on Tesla, generalizable); academic paper on multi-modal image fusion.

  - Sky & Environment: Macro shocks (inflation, Fed policy, M&A).
  - Top Banner Strip: Index/options signals (S&P 500, VIX, Put/Call Ratio).
- **Methodology**:
  - Preprocess data with specialized embeddings (FinBERT, TS2Vec, dense embeddings).
  - Encode embeddings into the Mega-Image using color/position rules.
  - ViT to process the Mega-Image, output state probabilities (hybrid model).
  - Markov Chain to model state transitions (Roaring, Purring, Hissing) with exponential convergence, using dynamic volatility thresholds.
- **Target**: Price direction (Buy/Sell/Hold) + Path prediction (Bounce/Stabilize/Continue) + Risk level.
- **Goals**: Practical tool for stock prediction (tested on Tesla, generalizable); academic paper on multi-modal image fusion, exponential convergence, and visual data encoding.
