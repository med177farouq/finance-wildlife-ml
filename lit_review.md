# Literature Review - Mega Image Model (Lion’s Voice)

## 1. Introduction (~300 words)
Financial markets are inherently chaotic, exhibiting complex, non-linear patterns that traditional models like ARIMA and GARCH struggle to capture effectively (Zhang et al., 2023). This complexity can be likened to a "wildlife ecosystem," where market signals manifest as distinct behaviors—roaring (sharp price spikes), purring (stability), and hissing (high volatility). Predicting these signals, such as price movements and market paths, remains a significant challenge due to the noisy, multi-modal nature of financial data, which includes structured price data, unstructured sources like news and social media sentiment, fundamentals, and macro indicators.

The rise of deep learning has offered new avenues for financial prediction, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proving effective for structured data like price series (Sezer & Ozbayoglu, 2020). However, these models are underutilized for integrating multi-modal data, and probabilistic models like Markov Chains often struggle with noisy financial data (Barra et al., 2020). Our project introduces the Mega Image Model (Lion’s Voice), a financial glyphboard—a visual embedding of the market’s multidimensional state, encoding fundamentals, real-time activity, and macro signals into a machine-readable snapshot for deep learning-based forecasting. We test this on Tesla (TSLA) data from April 2024 to March 2025, but the approach is generalizable to any stock. By preprocessing data with specialized embeddings (e.g., FinBERT, TS2Vec) and encoding it into a 512×512 Mega-Image, we enable a CNN to predict price direction (Buy/Sell), market path (Bounce/Stabilize/Continue), and risk level, with a Markov Chain for state transitions. This literature review surveys existing work on image-based financial prediction, multi-modal data integration, and volatility forecasting, identifying gaps that our novel framework addresses.

## 2. Image-Based Methods in Financial Prediction (~400 words)
Recent advancements in deep learning have explored converting financial time-series data into images for CNN-based prediction, leveraging the spatial pattern recognition capabilities of CNNs. Sezer and Ozbayoglu (2020) pioneered this approach by transforming price series into Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) and Markov Transition Fields (MTF), which preserve temporal dependencies in a visual format. Their CNN model achieved high accuracy in generating trading signals, demonstrating the potential of image-based methods. Similarly, Hoseinzade and Haratizadeh (2019) used candlestick charts as inputs to a CNN, outperforming traditional LSTM models in stock price prediction. More recently, Xu et al. (2024) applied GAF and recurrence plots to cryptocurrency price prediction, further validating the efficacy of image representations for capturing non-linear patterns.

Despite these advancements, image-based methods have significant limitations. Most studies focus solely on price data, ignoring unstructured sources like news, social media sentiment, fundamentals, and macro indicators, which are critical drivers of market movements (Sezer & Ozbayoglu, 2020; Xu et al., 2024). For instance, a price spike might be triggered by a news event or macro shock, which candlestick charts alone cannot capture. Additionally, these methods often rely on complex transformations like GAF, which may not be necessary for all applications. We advance image-based methods by introducing a Mega-Image, a 512×512 financial glyphboard—a visual embedding of multi-modal financial signals (fundamentals, price, sentiment, macro shocks), designed for machine interpretation with a CNN (@farouq). Unlike prior work, our Mega-Image uses a structured grid where each 2×2 pixel block encodes a specific signal (color = meaning, position = structure), capturing a broader range of data types in a single, abstract image. This approach enables a CNN to learn relationships across modalities directly from the image, addressing a key gap in the literature.

## 3. Multi-Modal Data in Financial ML (~450 words)
Integrating multi-modal data—combining structured price data with unstructured sources like news and social media sentiment—has shown promise in improving financial prediction accuracy. Mohan et al. (2019) combined news sentiment with stock prices using an LSTM model, achieving better performance than price-only models. Their approach processed news sentiment as a time-series alongside prices, demonstrating that qualitative data adds predictive power. Similarly, Li et al. (2022) surveyed text mining in finance, finding that news and social media sentiment can enhance price prediction, though integration remains challenging. DeepMind and Google Research (2023) used multi-modal transformers to combine price, news, and corporate filings, improving asset return forecasts.

However, these multi-modal studies have notable gaps. They process data separately (e.g., using LSTMs for news and prices), missing the opportunity to fuse them into a unified representation for more powerful models like CNNs (Mohan et al., 2019). Additionally, they lack granularity in handling news and sentiment. In our project, we preprocess multi-modal data using specialized embeddings (FinBERT for news, TS2Vec for prices, dense embeddings for fundamentals) before encoding into the Mega-Image, leveraging state-of-the-art methods to enhance input quality (@farouq). We filter news into Insider and Outsider factors, cluster headlines into topics using K-means, and apply an exponential decay model (\( e^{-\lambda t} \), \( \lambda = 0.5 \)) to X sentiment, capturing its temporal impact (@farouq). These embeddings are then mapped into a 512×512 Mega-Image, where each 2×2 pixel block encodes a signal (e.g., yellow for positive sentiment, purple for inflation shock), with position indicating the signal type (top = macro, middle = market flow, bottom = fundamentals) (@farouq). This visual embedding approach allows a CNN to learn relationships across modalities directly, addressing integration challenges and improving predictive power in a way not explored in the literature.

## 4. Volatility and Spike Prediction (~250 words)
Volatility forecasting is crucial for understanding market dynamics, particularly for predicting price spikes. Barra et al. (2020) used RNNs to forecast volatility, capturing non-linear patterns better than traditional GARCH models. Their approach incorporated market indices like the VIX, showing that volatility is influenced by both stock-specific and market-wide factors. However, their method did not use image-based techniques or multi-modal data, limiting its ability to capture qualitative drivers like news sentiment or macro shocks.

A key gap in volatility prediction is the lack of focus on path prediction (e.g., bounce, stabilize, continue) and expected return times to specific states. Additionally, traditional Markov Chain convergence methods struggle with noisy financial data, where rare transitions may not be captured effectively. We propose an exponential convergence framework (\( P^{\exp(n)} \)) to recover the transition matrix more efficiently, validated with a weather example where \( n = \exp(9) \) outperformed linear \( n = 700 \) (@farouq). This approach enhances our ability to model state transitions (Roaring, Purring, Hissing) and predict market paths. We further improve state modeling by using dynamic volatility thresholds (e.g., 1.5x rolling standard deviation for Roaring), making states adaptive to market conditions (@farouq). These innovations, combined with our Mega-Image’s ability to encode volatility signals (e.g., red blocks for high volatility), address limitations in prior methods and enable more accurate prediction of market behavior.

## 5. Research Gaps and Our Contribution (~300 words)
The literature reveals several gaps. Image-based methods (Sezer & Ozbayoglu, 2020; Xu et al., 2024) lack multi-modal data integration, focusing only on price data. Multi-modal studies (Mohan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022) do not use images or CNNs, processing data separately with models like LSTMs. Volatility prediction (Barra et al., 2020) misses path prediction and expected return times, and struggles with noisy data convergence. Additionally, prior work overlooks data integrity issues, such as avoiding double counting in time-series analysis (@farouq).

Our contribution addresses these gaps with the Mega Image Model (Lion’s Voice), a financial glyphboard—a new paradigm for encoding financial market states in a machine-readable visual format (@farouq). We combine technical (prices, TS2Vec embeddings), qualitative (news: FinBERT embeddings, clustered into topics), behavioral (X sentiment with exponential decay), fundamentals (dense embeddings), and macro indicators into a 512×512 Mega-Image, where each 2×2 pixel block encodes a signal (e.g., green = price up, purple = inflation shock), with position indicating the signal type (@farouq). A CNN processes the Mega-Image, extracting features to output state probabilities, which are used in a hybrid CNN-Markov model with exponential convergence to model state transitions (Roaring, Purring, Hissing) (@farouq). We use dynamic state definitions based on rolling volatility (@farouq). We target price direction (Buy/Sell), path prediction (Bounce/Stabilize/Continue), and risk level, using multi-step transitions and mean return times. Our model is generalizable to any stock, tested on Tesla (April 2024 - March 2025). This framework advances visual data encoding, introduces a novel convergence method, and enhances state modeling for financial prediction.
