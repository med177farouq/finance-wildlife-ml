## Paper Summaries - April 6, 2025
1. **Sezer & Ozbayoglu (2020)**: Converted price series to images (GAF, MTF), used CNNs for trading. Relevance: Validates image approach, but lacks sentiment/news.
2. **Hoseinzade & Haratizadeh (2019)**: Used candlestick charts for CNN prediction. Relevance: Aligns with our candlestick layer, we add more data.
3. **Mohan et al. (2019)**: Combined news sentiment with prices using LSTM. Relevance: Supports our data mix, but we use images.
4. **Zhang et al. (2023)**: Reviewed deep learning in finance, noted image methods as niche. Relevance: Sets context, shows our gap.
5. **Xu et al. (2024)**: Visualized time-series with GAF for CNNs. Relevance: Reinforces image methods, we extend with sentiment/news.
6. **Li et al. (2022)**: Surveyed text mining in finance. Relevance: Supports our news/sentiment use, we innovate with images.
7. **Barra et al. (2020)**: Used RNNs for volatility forecasting. Relevance: Supports our spike target, we use CNNs and images.
