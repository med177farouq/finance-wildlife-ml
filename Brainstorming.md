Let’s start with a focused brainstorming session to explore your concept more deeply. Here are some prompts and ideas to get us going—feel free to add your thoughts or tweak these as we discuss!
1. Refining the Core Idea

    What’s the Vision?: You want to transform financial “noise” (prices, news, sentiment, reports) into images, like we did with lion sounds, and use CNNs to predict outcomes (e.g., price direction, risk). Why images? To capture patterns across diverse data types in a way traditional models might miss.
    Finance Meets Wildlife: How far do we take the analogy? Could we treat market signals as “animal behaviors”—e.g., “roaring” (volatile spikes), “purring” (stable trends)—and classify them visually?
    Novelty: Is the innovation in the image representation, the mix of data, or both? Let’s pin down what sets this apart.

2. Data Sources to Explore

    Numerical: Stock prices (OHLC), volatility indices (VIX), economic indicators (GDP, rates).
    Textual: News headlines, earnings call transcripts, analyst reports.
    Sentiment: X posts, Reddit chatter, Google Trends.
    Wildcards: Insider trades, weather data (for commodity stocks), or even audio from CEO speeches (like .wav files!).
    Mixing It: How do we combine these visually? Stack them (e.g., RGB channels)? Overlay them? Create a “financial spectrogram”?

3. Prediction Targets

    Price: Up/Down, percentage change.
    Risk: Volatility, crash probability.
    Other: Buy/sell signals, portfolio allocation shifts.
    Multi-Task: Could one model predict both price and risk from the same image?

4. Image Representation Ideas

    Time-Series Plots: Candlesticks or line graphs for prices.
    Heatmaps: Sentiment scores or news word frequencies over time.
    Hybrid: A 2D grid where rows are data types (price, sentiment, news) and columns are time steps.
    Creative Twist: Could we use Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) or Markov Transition Fields (MTF) from prior research, but extend them to non-price data?

5. Practical vs. Academic Goals

    Practical: A tool traders could use—fast, accurate, deployable.
    Academic: A new method—publishable in a journal like Neural Networks or a conference like NeurIPS.
    Balance: Start with a practical prototype (e.g., Tesla stock prediction), then generalize for academia.
